# Automated Interest-Based Content Curation (Experimental)
This document outlines an experimental method for curating a social media feed based on specified interests. Please note: This approach utilizes automation and has been observed to trigger platform-side flags for automated behavior, potentially leading to account restrictions. We advise extreme caution if considering this method.
## Methodology
Our approach combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with browser automation (Selenium) to dynamically influence content algorithms. The process is as follows:
 * Interest-Driven User Generation: An LLM is prompted with a user's interests. Based on these inputs, the LLM intelligently generates a list of relevant users or accounts to follow.
 * Automated Login: Using Selenium, our system securely logs into the target social media account with provided credentials (username and password).
 * Algorithmic Influence through Following: The system then programmatically navigates to and follows the pages of the users generated by the LLM. By actively following these accounts, we aim to signal to the platform's algorithm that these topics and accounts are of high interest, thereby subtly altering the content displayed in the user's feed.
## Rationale
This method was conceived as a workaround due to the lack of direct API access, which would typically be the preferred and more compliant way to interact with a platform's features. By simulating user behavior (following accounts), we attempt to achieve algorithmic modification without directly violating platform terms of service that might pertain to API misuse.#
